## Course Notes

Professor Love maintains a set of Course Notes, titled **Data Science for Biological, Medical and Health Research: Notes for 432.** Professor Love revises the Notes annually, and various updates will appear as the semester progresses.

Although these Notes share some of the features of a textbook, they are neither comprehensive nor completely original. The main purpose is to give 432 students a set of common materials on which to draw during the course, providing a series of examples using R to work through issues that are likely to come up during the semester, and in later work. 

In addition, **slides** and video recordings from each of Professor Love's lectures, plus other in-class materials will be posted for your use throughout the semester.

Once class begins, you'll be able to access all materials (including the Course Notes) through the main course website at <https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/>.

## Buy This Book!

You need to buy Jeff Leekâ€™s **How to be a Modern Scientist**, available electronically through <https://leanpub.com/modernscientist>. The suggested cost is $10, but you can pay what you want.

You can read the book in about four hours. We will expect you to have done so by the end of January.

## Other Books to Download

There are three additional **free** books that you will definitely want to obtain during the semester and may be interested in looking at before class begins. Simply visit the links below.

1. [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin.
2. [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham (first edition). Note that the second edition (work in progress) may be better for our purposes, and is found at https://r4ds.hadley.nz/.
3. [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research](https://hbiostat.org/bbr/) by Frank E. Harrell Jr. The related set of YouTube videos can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-o_ZZ0tuFUYn8e8rf-QURA).
