# Teaching Assistants {#sec-teachingassistants}

Most of this year's stellar group of teaching assistants have been in your shoes - they've taken the course in the past, and they enjoyed it enough to come back for more. They are volunteering their precious time and energy to help make the course happen, and we couldn't be more delighted to welcome you to the course. All office hours and all teaching assistant work will be done remotely.

There is a lot to learn in this class. Don't suffer in silence - talk to us! As mentioned earlier, **you shouldn't spend more than 15 minutes struggling with anything in this class without asking for help.**

Visit the [Getting Help with 432](05-gettinghelp.qmd) section of this Syllabus for more details.

## TA office hours

TA office hours are held via Zoom, will begin on Friday 2024-01-19 and continue through Wednesday 2024-05-01 except for Spring Break (no office hours March 9-16) and April 8 (Eclipse).

Ali Elsharkawi is in his third year in the M.S program in Clinical Research. He completed his bachelor’s in medicine, and fellowship in Electrophysiology at Metrohealth in Cleveland. For his research interest, he studied the outcome of atrial fibrillation ablation procedures. Ali took 431 and 432 two years ago and he is applying the skills he learned in his research projects. Ali enjoys spending time with his family, playing music, watching soccer, and traveling.

### Chenyu Liu {#sec-chenyu}

![Chenyu Liu](images/Chenyu_Liu.png){width=40%}

Chenyu Liu is a first-year Ph.D. student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics within the Department of Population & Quantitative Health Sciences. Chenyu completed her undergraduate studies in statistics at Wuhan University of Technology in China and her master's program in statistics at Case. Her current research interest is Bayesian Statistics, multi-omics data integration, and proteomics analysis. Outside of her Ph.D. life, Chenyu spends her time traveling, cooking, and watching movies.

### Alex Olejko {#sec-alex}

![Alex Olejko](images/Alex_Olejko.png){width=40%}

Alex is a 5th year PhD candidate in the Developmental, Cognitive, and Affective Sciences program in the Department of Psychological Sciences. He completed my undergraduate education at Ohio State, and earned my Master’s degree from CWRU in 2022. His research mainly resides in the field of behavior genetics, where he focuses on polygenic influences on behavioral outcomes. These outcomes mostly encompass educational and health phenotypes in the early to mid-twenties. Alex grew up outside of Cleveland and am a fervent Cleveland sports fan. He loves going to Guardians games and have already been to 20 this year (and counting). Some of his other favorite past-times include building Lego, mixology, exercise, and (mainly) single-player video games.

### Lindsay Petrenchik {#sec-lindsay}

![Lindsay Petrenchik](images/Lindsay_Petrenchik.png){width=40%}

Lindsay Petrenchik is a PGY1 Pharmacy Resident at University Hospital Samaritan Medical Center and a Clinical Instructor of Pharmacy Practice at Northeast Ohio Medical University. Prior to residency, Lindsay worked at Novartis for two years where she evaluated Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) in oncology clinical trials. She is excited to share with you how she has used 431/432 super-power skills daily in both pharmaceutical industry and residency research projects. Come to her TA sessions and you will have a blast learning R and statistical methods!

### Miza Salim Hammoud {#sec-miza}

![Miza Salim Hammoud](images/Miza_Salim_Hammoud.png){width=40%}

Miza Salim Hammoud is a postdoctoral research fellow at Cleveland Clinic’s Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery Department and is in her second year of the Masters of Science in Clinical Research (CRSP) program at CWRU. Her research goal is to construct predictive models that illuminate the path ahead for little lives touched by congenital heart defects, predicting both clinical outcomes and the quality of life perceived by patients and their families. Miza took 431 and 432 last year and is applying the amazing research skills gained from these two classes in her research projects. Beyond the realm of academia and research, Miza enjoys playing the piano’s melody, painting colors on canvas, and embarks on adventures that span the globe embracing the wonders of new countries and cultures. 

### Monika Strah {#sec-monika}

![Monika Strah](images/Monika_Strah.png){width=40%}

Monika Strah is a Ph.D. student in Clinical Translational Science at CWRU and recently
completed the Biostatistics M.S. program. She is looking forward to returning as a TA for PQHS 431/432 and also enjoyed TAing for PQHS 453 this summer. Monika’s past research includes mathematical approaches to questions in population genetics and human evolution and is presently studying dietary factors associated with lung cancer risk and multiple sclerosis related fatigue management strategies. Monika enjoys reading, hiking and is a member of the National Ski Patrol.

### Ria Tilve {#sec-ria}

![Ria Tilve](images/Ria_Tilve.png){width=40%}

Ria Tilve is a first year medical student at CWRU. After completing her bachelor's in Biochemistry, she obtained her MPH in Population Health Research at CWRU last spring. Her current research focuses on musculoskeletal health and biomedical imaging. Ria took 431 and 432 during the 2021-2022 school year, and she is applying those skills in her research projects. Outside of studying, Ria enjoys spending time with her family, running, watching sports, and exploring new places.

### Zoey Zou {#sec-zoey}

![Zoey Zou](images/Zoey_Zou.png){width=40%}

Zoey Zou is a first-year Ph.D. student in the Epidemiology & Biostatistics program within the Department of Population & Quantitative Health Sciences. She uses the pronouns “she/her/hers.” Her research interests lie in the methodology of clinical trial designs. Statistics is a fascinating field and can provide answers to many questions in clinical trial design, such as determining whether observed differences are real or due to chance. She also hopes to make contributions to oncology studies. She enjoys reading, skiing, and watching movies, specifically science fiction films. Her favorite movie is "2001: A Space Odyssey." Zoey is excited about the opportunity to engage and connect with students this semester, both in and out of the classroom.
