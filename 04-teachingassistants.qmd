# Teaching Assistants {#sec-teachingassistants}

Most of this year's stellar group of teaching assistants have been in your shoes - they've taken the course in the past, and they enjoyed it enough to come back for more. They are volunteering their precious time and energy to help make the course happen, and we couldn't be more delighted to welcome you to the course. All office hours and all teaching assistant work will be done remotely.

There is a lot to learn in this class. Don't suffer in silence - talk to us! As mentioned earlier, **you shouldn't spend more than 15 minutes struggling with anything in this class without asking for help.**

Visit the [Getting Help with 432](05-gettinghelp.qmd) section of this Syllabus for more details.

## TA office hours

TA office hours are held via Zoom, will begin in mid-January and continue through the end of the semester, excluding Spring Break. The weekly schedule appears on our [Contact Us page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/contact.html) as well as our [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/calendar.html).

- Our Shared Google Drive (PQHS 432 Spring 2025 Dr Love and Students) will contain Zoom links for each of these sessions. 
  - No appointment is necessary. Please just drop in. 
  - Be sure to log into Google via CWRU to access the shared Drive.

Professor Love will also hold "office hours" after each class to the extent possible.

Monika Strah is a Ph.D. student in Clinical Translational Science at CWRU and a graduate of the Biostatistics M.S. program. She is looking forward to returning as a TA for PQHS 431/432 and also enjoyed TAing for PQHS 453. Monika’s research has included mathematical approaches to questions in population genetics and human evolution, examining dietary factors associated with lung cancer risk and analysis of multiple sclerosis related fatigue management strategies. Monika enjoys reading, hiking and is a member of the National Ski Patrol.

### Alex Olejko {#sec-alex}

Alex is a PhD candidate in the Developmental, Cognitive, and Affective Sciences program in the Department of Psychological Sciences. He completed my undergraduate education at Ohio State, and earned my Master’s degree from CWRU in 2022. His research mainly resides in the field of behavior genetics, where he focuses on polygenic influences on behavioral outcomes. These outcomes mostly encompass educational and health phenotypes in the early to mid-twenties. Alex grew up outside of Cleveland and am a fervent Cleveland sports fan. He loves going to Guardians games and have already been to 20 this year (and counting). Some of his other favorite past-times include building Lego, mixology, exercise, and (mainly) single-player video games.

She then completed both a Master’s in mathematics and a Master’s in statistics at the same institution before coming to CWRU to start her PhD. Her current research is in statistical methodology development and analysis in phase III clinical trials focusing on multiple sclerosis drug treatments. Outside of school, Kathryn enjoys spending time with her husband and two cats binge watching numerous TV shows. She also is hoping to get back into singing (she is a classically trained opera singer) in the near future!
