## A More Complete Biography 

Hi. I am Thomas E. Love, Ph.D. and I have at least three different jobs.

- I am a Professor in the Departments of Medicine and of [Population & Quantitative Health Sciences](https://case.edu/medicine/pqhs/) at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/). I teach three courses per year there (PQHS 431, 432 and 500) and also lead the [Health Care Analytics track](https://case.edu/medicine/pqhs/education/biostatistics-and-epidemiology/ms-biostatistics/biostatistics-ms-curriculum/health-care-analytics) of the MS program in Biostatistics.
- I direct [Biostatistics and Data Science](https://www.metrohealth.org/population-health-research-institute/biostatistics-and-data-sciences) at the [Population Health Research Institute](https://www.metrohealth.org/population-health-research-institute) and at the [Center for Health Care Research and Policy](https://www.metrohealth.org/population-health-research-institute/center-for-health-care-research-and-policy) at [The MetroHealth System](https://www.metrohealth.org/).
- For ten years, I was the (founding) Data Director for [Better Health Partnership](http://betterhealthpartnership.org/), an alliance of people who provide, pay for and receive care in Northeast Ohio. I still consult occasionally with them and hold the position of Chief Data Scientist there.
- I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and have won numerous awards for my teaching and my research, including the 2018 [John S. Diekhoff Award for Graduate Teaching](https://students.case.edu/traditions/awards/diekhoff/) from CWRU.
- I have been teaching at CWRU since 1994, and have taught every manner of CWRU student over the years, especially students in biostatistics, medicine, and management.

In research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services. I mostly work with observational data, rather than data that emerge from randomized clinical trials, and I have a special interest in working with data from electronic health records.

- You may be interested in a [study in Health Affairs](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/34/7/1121.abstract) showing the impact of a [Medicaid-like expansion plan on care and outcomes of poor patients in Cleveland](http://thedaily.case.edu/new-study-shows-prepared-safety-net-improves-care-saves-money-in-medicaid-expansion-population/).
- Or you might be interested in our [New England Journal of Medicine study](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1102519) of the effect of electronic health records on the care and outcomes of people with diabetes.
- In 2011, [James O'Malley](http://tdi.dartmouth.edu/faculty/a-james-omalley-phd) and I chaired the [Ninth International Conference on Health Policy Statistics](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/ichps/2011/index.cfm?fuseaction=main), here in Cleveland. Here's a [recap](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10742-012-0096-8). 
- I've also worked on many projects involving the use of propensity scores to make causal inferences from observational studies, particularly in heart failure.

I hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation adviser was Paul Rosenbaum. I am married to a brilliant woman who is an attorney at Savant Systems, and we are raising two terrific sons. The elder is finishing a MS in Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and the younger is in his first year of law school at Fordham University in New York. We live in Shaker Heights. I sing and act occasionally in [community theater](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater), do lots of puzzles and play golf when I can.

Thanks to Dr. Love’s recovery from a broken leg and ankle surgery, this year’s 432 class will be held remotely (via Zoom) before Spring Break, and then (mostly) in person starting March 18.
