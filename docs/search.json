Love, Ph.D. and I have at least three different jobs.\nIn research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services. I mostly work with observational data, rather than data that emerge from randomized clinical trials, and I have a special interest in working with data from electronic health records.\nIf you want to see a pretty complete list of my publications, knock yourself out.\nI hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation adviser was Paul Rosenbaum. I am married to a brilliant woman who is an attorney at Savant Systems, and we are raising two terrific sons. The elder is finishing a MS in Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and the younger is in his first year of law school at Fordham University in New York. We live in Shaker Heights. I sing and act occasionally in community theater, do lots of puzzles and play golf when I can.\nThanks to Dr. Love’s recovery from a broken leg and ankle surgery, this year’s 432 class will be held remotely (via Zoom) before Spring Break, and then (mostly) in person starting March 18.",

To that end, students are requested not to dispute any grading on Labs 1-7 during the semester. Instead, should you receive a lower grade on a Lab than you feel you deserve based on the feedback the TA provides, the answer sketch and the grading rubric, you can submit a request for a regrade by Professor Love by submitting the Google Form found at https://bit.ly/432-2025-lab-regrades by the deadline in the Calendar.\nStudents are welcome to ask questions of Professor Love about grading during the term. The TAs and Professor Love are happy to discuss in a general sense any questions about an assignment, but no grades will be changed until the end of the term. - The one exception is if there is a mistake in adding up points, or some similar clerical error. If you find such an issue, please bring it to Professor Love’s attention via email, and such problems will be corrected immediately.\nAt the end of the semester, after Professor Love has worked out what letter grade to give each student, he will go through the requests on the form and determine for each whether the student’s letter grade would change if all of the points in dispute were granted. If the answer is no, then he won’t even look at the disputed grade(s). If the answer is yes, then he will look very carefully to see if enough extra points are merited to change a grade. (It will not help your case to submit frivolous requests.)\nThe main advantage of this system is that it saves all of us the hassle of haggling over points that are never going to mean anything anyway. It also provides “equal access” to students who are too timid to express their concerns.

Unauthorized absence from a final examination will result in a failing grade. When the student completes the work, the Incomplete is changed to an A, B, C, D, P, F, or NP.\n\n\nAll work for the incomplete grade must be made up and the change of grade recorded in the Office of the University Registrar by the date specified by the instructor, but no later than the last day of class in the semester following the one in which the Incomplete was received. A student who has a permanent Incomplete for a required course must retake the course in a later term. If the student cannot complete the work by the end of the following semester, he or she must petition for an extension which must be endorsed by the instructor, explain the reasons why the work has not been completed, and include a new date for completion.

So you’ll need to take advantage of every opportunity you have to write more effectively tomorrow than you do today.\nHere’s what I find to be a compelling argument from George Cobb …\n\nIf you want your work with data to make a difference, devote time and effort to choosing the words and pictures you use to present your evidence and conclusions. If you teach or supervise, seek to reward those - they who learn from you, and they who report to you – when they spend time crafting their message.\n\n\nThink back to the last “report” you were expected to read. Is it easy to recall the main points? The answer, yes or no, depends not so much on the quality of the data, the effort, and the thinking that went into the report, nor on your own dutiful diligence in reading the report, but rather, and mainly, on whether the people who wrote the report had learned and practiced the skills of how to use words and pictures, first, to claim attention, and second, to claim retention: to deliver a message that sticks in the mind.",

    "text": "9.6 A Few Tips from Professor Love\n\nStatistics is a “getting the details right” business - we care deeply about details, and this applies to writing code or complete English sentences. RStudio has a spell-checker. To use it, click F7.\nNothing impresses us as much as a clear and concise argument, presented using well-written English sentences, effective and well-labeled figures and tables.\nDon’t parrot back material that Professor Love wrote or said. State ideas in your own words. Stating them in my words is, technically, plagiarism.\nEdit your more adventurous output; don’t present everything you know how to do in R, and don’t forget that someone is trying to read both your code and your results.\nMake your work easy to evaluate. In responding to an assignment, be sure to answer the question that was asked, restating it as necessary.\nClearly label everything: graphs, tables, your answer to a specific question. Everything. Again, make your work easy to evaluate.\nSimplify. Emphasize ideas in plain language. Avoid jargon. Use English well.\nData are plural. Use “the data are …” rather than “the data is …”\nA paragraph must contain more than one sentence.\n\nDon’t switch tenses. If you want to write in the present tense, stick to it throughout.\nDon’t write or say random sample unless you used a random number generator. If you used haphazard sampling or convenience sampling, call it what it is, and indicate whether any problems could have cropped up as a result.\nSimilarly, don’t defend a method of data collection because it is random. Most of the time we want to represent some population, and a random sample is just one way to ensure that certain types of biases have a low probability of creeping in.\nIf you want to write that you used \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) as a significance level, then state that your results were obtained using a 95% confidence level, not a 95% confidence interval, unless you are actually interpreting a confidence interval.\n\nIf you find yourself in the appalling situation of writing about a p-value, then you should state something like:\n\n[1] We’re using a 95% confidence level.\n[2] We’re using a 5% significance level.\n\n[3] We’re using \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\).\n\nDon’t use more than one of these expressions.\n\nAgain, don’t use p-values in most settings, but if you must, refer to all p-values that are less than 0.001 or perhaps less than 0.0001 as \\(p &lt; 0.001\\), rather than, for instance, \\(p = 0.00000001\\) or, worse yet, \\(p = 0\\). In a similar vein, write all \\(p\\)-values that exceed 0.99 as \\(p &gt; 0.99\\) instead of, for instance, \\(p  = 1\\).\nTo the extent possible, don’t use computer-ese to label variables, plots or tables. R and Quarto allow you to change the labels on graphs and tables to meaningful things – do so. Use meaningful abbreviations, as necessary, explaining what they mean on the first usage.\nWhen in doubt, err on the side of clarity. Clear thinking leads to clear writing.\n\nFinally, don’t use the phrase “statistically significant” or “statistically detectable” in your writing. It’s not helpful.",

All forms of academic dishonesty including cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation, and obstruction are violations of academic integrity standards and will result in a minimum penalty of receiving a zero for the assignment, the potential for failing the entire course. Cheating includes copying from another’s work, falsifying problem solutions or laboratory reports, or using unauthorized sources, notes or computer programs. Plagiarism includes the presentation, without proper attribution, of another’s words or ideas from printed or electronic sources. It is also plagiarism to submit, without the instructor’s consent, an assignment in one class previously submitted in another. Misrepresentation includes forgery of official academic documents, the presentation of altered or falsified documents or testimony to a university office or official, taking an exam for another student, or lying about personal circumstances to postpone tests or assignments. Obstruction occurs when a student engages in unreasonable conduct that interferes with another’s ability to conduct scholarly activity. Destroying a student’s computer file, stealing a student’s notebook, and stealing a book on reserve in the library are examples of obstruction. In addition, the incident will be reported to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and Academic Review Board for undergraduates or Senior Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, for Graduate Students.\n\nThe CWRU Statement of Ethics for graduate students can be found here: http://case.edu/gradstudies/about-the-school/policies-procedures/",
